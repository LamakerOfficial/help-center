# Creating a Ticket
While creating a ticket may be simple to do, this article will also provide recommendations on how you should provide your question or issue to our staff members to give clear communication to them.

## Viewing our Discord
All tickets are done via our Discord server, when signing up for Falix you'll automatically be added to our Discord server. If not, for whatever reason, you can join [here](https://discord.gg/falixnodes).

## Creating the Ticket
View our tickets channel found under the Support category. Then, type the following command:
```
=new
```

Then follow on-screen instructions, providing our bot what kind of ticket you're creating. Make sure to provide a clear message for your problem, read below **Providing Clear Communication**.

After using the `=new` command, a new channel will be created, which should be visible at the bottom of the channels list.

## Providing Clear Communication
When explaining your problem to our bot, you should make your message as clear as possible so that our staff members can understand what the issue is and try solving it right away. If your message isn't clear enough, it will take longer for us to understand what's wrong.

Saying stuff like "help me" or "server is crashing" is a very poor choice of words, as this really doesn't say much for us staff members. All we know is that you need help, which is already obvious since you're creating a ticket in the first place or yes your server is crashing, but there are like a million outcomes to why a server may have crashed.

I, Korbs, believe you should do a checklist before creating a ticket, and at least do better self-troubleshooting on your own. Spoon-feeding isn't something we like to do.

## Checklist
 - [Console and Logs](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/creating-a-ticket#console-and-logs)
 - [Look Around the Help Center](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/creating-a-ticket#look-around-the-help-center)
 - [Outage or Maintenance](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/creating-a-ticket#outage-or-maintenance)

### Console and Logs
The console can provide helpful information when something goes wrong, usually this *helpful* information recommends you to do something in order to resolve the issue on your own.

Let's see some examples:
 - Minecraft 1.17 not used with Java 16, console outputs:
 ```
 Minecraft 1.17 requires running the server Java 16 or above. Download Java 16 (or above) from https://adoptopenjdk.net/
 ```
 The instructions are clear and easy to understand on what the issue is, in this case you're trying to run a Minecraft 1.17 server with a version of Java that it doesn't support. The instructions are saying to use Java 16 instead, so run the server with Java 16 instead.

 - You have a corrupted jar file, console outputs:
 ```
 Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile server.jar or custom.jar
 ```
 This means something is wrong with the jar file you're using for your server. Simply just replace the jar file with a replacement. 

 If you're having this issue with BungeeCord, [read here](#).

### Look Around the Help Center
You're here, might as well look around. If you're having an issue, it may have already been covered here at our help center. We also do have a troubleshooting tab that you should also check out.

### Outage or Maintenance
There may be an issue that we're aware of and there's a chance we may have announced it already in our status or announcements channel on our Discord server.
