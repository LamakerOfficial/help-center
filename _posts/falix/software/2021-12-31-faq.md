Q: **Why and what's the point of this software?**

A: Originally, the software was created by a member of the community to avoid having to use their web browser to access FalixNodes. FalixNodes Desktop served as a fast and intuitive way to access FalixNodes' services, and it continues to do so today.

Q: **Who is the developer of FalixNodes Desktop?**

A: FalixNodes Desktop is developed and owned by **Korbs Studio**. To be clear, Korbs Studio owns the code to ONLY FalixNodes Desktop for desktop and does NOT have ownership over FalixNodes itself.

Q: **Can I use FalixNodes Desktop?**

A: It supports Windows 7/8/10/11, macOS Yosemite and up, and Linux. You may be able to run FalixNodes Desktop on a chromebook as well.

As for mobile, you can try out our [mobile app](https://falixnodes.net/app/), which serves the same purpose as our desktop software.

Q: **Where to download?**

A: [https://desktop.falixnodes.net](https://desktop.falixnodes.net)

Q: **Can I download it from somewhere else other than the Microsoft Store?**

A: https://updates.korbsstudio.com/falix-software/falixnodes-software-3.2.2.zip or check for latest ZIP file at https://updates.korbsstudio.com

<br>

Q: **How do I update it?**

A: This is done automatically on Windows and Linux. We recommend that you wait at least 1 - 2 minutes for the update to download in the background, or depending on your internet speed.

On macOS, you must manually install each update. You don't have to do this every time; if you want the latest version in general, you may update. This is due to the fact that we need to sign our DMG file in order for updates to function; we are still working on signing the DMG file with our Apple Certificate.
