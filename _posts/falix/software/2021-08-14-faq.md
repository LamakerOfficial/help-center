Q: **How do I update it?**

A: This is done automatically on Windows and Linux. We recommend that you wait at least 1 - 2 minutes for the update to download in the background, or depending on your internet speed.

On macOS, you must manually install each update. You don't have to do this every time; if you want the latest version in general, you may update. This is due to the fact that we need to sign our DMG file in order for updates to function; we are still working on signing the DMG file with our Apple Certificate.
