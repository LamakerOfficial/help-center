# Signing Up

 On our client panel, simply click on the button that says “Discord” and log in with your Discord account. Once done, you should be on our Client Panel and you should also see our server on your Discord.

# Being Part of our Discord Server
## Keeping a Safe Community
By being on our Discord server, you're agreeing to follow our rules, Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) to keep our members safe!

## Creating a Ticket
We've created a new article for this, [view here](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/creating-a-ticket).

# Creating a Server
On our Client Panel, you can create a server by using the Create Server button found on the left sidebar. Fill in the name you would like to call your server, amount of memory, and a location for where you want your server to be. Once the server is created, it will start installing (usually takes a couple of minutes). To gain access to features like console, file manager, databases, and more you need to head over to our Game Panel.
