# Your Account
## Identifying
In FalixNodes, we identify accounts by their Discord user ID and/or email.

Click [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) to visit a Discord article on information to obtain your Discord user ID.

## Transferring
It is currently not possible to transfer your Falix account and servers to another account. We also don't allow multiple accounts, so using another account on our platform will be detected as an alt account. You should stay with your current account and continue to use it to log into our service.
