If you need to give other users access to your server panel, you can easily do so using the "users" feature in the game panel, follow the steps below to learn how:

> Make sure the user you are adding is already registered in Falix, otherwise this will not work.

1. Go to the [Game Panel](https://panel.falixnodes.net) and click on your server.
2. Click on the "Users" tab at the top of the page.
3. Click on "New User" at the bottom right of the page.
4. Insert the email of the user you want to add to your server in the given field.
5. Tick the boxes depending on the permission you want to give the user.
6. Click on "Invite User".
7. Ask the user you added to check their Game Panel, they should have access to the server.
