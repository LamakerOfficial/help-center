# Guide On How To Use Databases
## What Are Databases?
Databases are an organized collection of information. 
The database our panel supports is [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org).
MariaDB is a very popular open source database which was developed by the original MySQL developers.

## What Are Databases Useful For? 
Some server plugins, bots, or systems may require a database to store information. Minecraft plugins will usually state whether they need/support an SQL database.

# Getting Started
## Step 1: Allocating A Database To Your Server

1. Go to the [Client Panel](https://client.falixnodes.net).
2. Scroll down and click on "Add Database".
