Currently, there are two ways of getting FalixCoins. You can find them [here](https://client.falixnodes.net/coins).

# Referring
You can refer our service to your friends. If they register with your referral link, you'll earn 200 FalixCoins. Follow the steps below to learn how to create a referral link:
1. Go to the [affiliate page](https://client.falixnodes.net/affiliate/index).
2. Scroll down and copy your affliate link.

To use your affiliate link, simply paste the link into any browser.

> Alting is **strictly prohibited**.

# Joining Discord Servers

Make sure your Discord account is connected to your FalixNodes account. You can do so by following the [Account Management guide](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/account-management/).

1. Go to the [Join For Rewards](https://client.falixnodes.net/join_for_rewards) page.
2. You should see a list of servers on the right. Click on the "join" button next to a server to join it.
3. To receive coins for joining servers, click on "Get FalixCoins For Joined Servers". The button is located above the server list. If this does not work, make sure to try relogging (logging out and logging back in).
