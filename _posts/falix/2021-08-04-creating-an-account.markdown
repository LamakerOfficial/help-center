# Your Account
## Identifying
On Falix, we identify accounts using their Discord ID, this is used to search for users on our staff admin panel.

To get your Discord ID on Discord, please enable developer mode in your appearance settings. Head over to the account settings, click on the 3 dots button on the right side and click Copy ID.

## Transferring
It is currently not possible to transfer your Falix server and account to another Discord account. We also don't allow multiple accounts, so using another Discord account on our platform will be detected as an alt account. You should stay with your current Discord account and continue to use it to log in to our service.

# Managing
## Resetting Your Password
If you've forgotten your account's password for your Game Panel, please click on Forgot Password button, which should be under the Login button. Type in your Game Panel email and wait for an email to arrive in your inbox.

You could also log into the Client Panel and head over to your profile settings, then click on reset Game Panel password, which will automatically generate a random password for you to use.

If you've not forgotten your password and just want to use a new password, click on the account icon at the top of the Game Panel, then reset your password there.

## Deleting Account
To delete your account, go to our Client Panel > click on your profile > click settings. Click Delete Account, just to make sure you'll need to confirm a few times.
