# How to automatically backup your server files?

### What is DriveBackupV2?
Drivebackup is a plugin that automatically backs up your server to the cloud, or to your own device!

## Setting up DriveBackupV2

1. Set up the server, you can use Spigot or any of its forks, we recommend using [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net) or [Paper](https://papermc.io).
2. Open the file manager.
3. Find and click on the folder named "plugins".
4. Download the [DriveBackupV2](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/drivebackupv2/files/latest) and upload it to the folder.
5. Restart the server.
6. Go back to the "plugins" folder, you should see that a new folder was generated, it is usually named "DriveBackupV2".
7. Read the [docs](https://github.com/MaxMaeder/DriveBackupV2/wiki) for instructions on how to set it up.
8. once you are done setting up everything, restart the server to load changes.


> NOTE: your server must be on for the plugin to run.
