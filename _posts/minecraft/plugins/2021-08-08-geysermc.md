# How to make a cross-platform server

## What is GeyserMC?
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible to allow for true cross-platform.

## How does it work?
Geyser is a middleware, which translates all the incoming and outgoing packets. With this being said, Geyser works as a standalone proxy, meaning you can use it to join any modern Minecraft Java server. Geyser can also be installed on your server as a plugin, so you can easily make your server compatible with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## Prerequisites
```
Make sure your server has the latest Minecraft java edition version (currently 1.17.1)

Your bedrock client has to be a supported version (currently 1.17 / 1.17.1 / 1.17.2 )
```

# Setting up GeyserMC

2. Open the file manager.
3. Find and open a folder called "plugins".
4. Upload the plugin you downloaded, you can find the download link at the top of this page.
5. Restart the server.
6. Go back to the plugins folder, you should see that a new folder was generated, it is usually called "Geyser-Spigot".
7. Open it then click on "config.yml".
